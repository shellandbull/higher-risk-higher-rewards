The abundance of data, ideas & stories available is more than ever before.\nThis scientific journal targets hobbyists who use regular apps for trading, with a focus on a simple strategy known as pairs trading.\nPairs trading involves choosing two financial instruments, typically stocks, that historically show a strong correlation in their price movements. The core idea is that these instruments’ prices tend to move together, and deviations from this correlation can create profitable trading opportunities.\nHere’s how the strategy works:\nThis scientific journal is a straightforward study on flipping pairs, helping hobbyists better understand why and how they do it this way.\nUsing modern tools for scientific-grade research like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, LLMs & prompt engineering & Jupyter. We concluded that using the most volatile pairs in the market tend to yield the best rewards for this particular average joe strategy.\nThe study concludes that when aiming for the highest profits, flipping shitcoins is the way to go",

When this difference deviates significantly from its usual range, it suggests a trading opportunity.\nEnter the Trade:\n\nLong Position: Buy the security that is cheaper than usual compared to its pair.\nShort Position: Sell the security that is more expensive than usual compared to its pair.\n\nConvergence: The trade becomes profitable when the price difference returns to its normal range, as the prices of the two securities move back in sync.",

    "text": "0.2 Methodology\nThe methodology of this study is best described by splitting it into 2 subsections, tooling & process.\n\n0.2.1 Tooling\nThe author of this study is not an experienced statician, actuarial scientist nor a data engineer.\nI am a software engineer that’s worked with Ruby/Rails & Node.js. I wanted to use Python & it’s data science ecosystem for the study without having to invest a large amount of time picking up a new syntax and set of libraries.\nWith new AI on the table, I decided to preload an LLM with the relevant context & guide as if I was a technical lead guiding a developer through a tech stack I’m not savvy in. With that in mind, here’s the full list of tools & techniques I used as-is to set this up:\n\nYahoo Finance for fetching financial instrument pricing data in a timeseries format\nBinancce for fetching cryptocurrency financial instrument pricing data in a timeseries format\nPython as the programming platform for the study\nNumpy for array manipulation\nPandas for data analysis\nMatplotlib for data visualisation\nJupyter Notebook for organising everything together in a readable format\nQuarto for technical publishing\nDistill for inspiration on producing high grade scientific-style journals\nModelling and simulation in Pyhon for modelling the investment strategy\nChatGPT for bridging human language to Python syntax, albeit all the code was reviewed by me\nI also bounced ideas off a colleague. Shout out Kira McLean & Scicloj\n\n\n\n0.2.2 Process\nThe code for this study can be found on the @shellandbull/higher-risk-higher-rewards\nUsing personal, hobbyist-level, financial investment knowledge a pairs trading strategy was devised. The strategy is fairly simple\n2 Financial instruments are selected, let us call them A & B. This flavour of pairs trading relies on actively tracking price changes between the 2 instruments to maximise gains by buying/selling them against each other. Let us go over an iteration of the strategy\nWe start with 1 Bitcoin and 220 Tesla stocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBTC/USD - Price\nBTC/USD - Amount\nTSLA/USD - Price\nTSLA/USD - Amount\nPortfolio Value\n\n\n\n\n60,000\n1.00\n220\n200\n$104,000\n\n\n\nTime goes by, and the prices change slightly. Bitcoin became more expensive, Tesla became cheaper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBTC/USD - Price\nBTC/USD - Amount\nTSLA/USD - Price\nTSLA/USD - Amount\nPortfolio Value\n\n\n\n\n63,000\n1.00\n190\n200\n$101,000\n\n\n\nAn opportunity pops out the water to say “What’s upppppp dawg”.\nWe allocate .3 BTC so $18,900 into Tesla. This means we bought 99.47 Tesla stocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBTC/USD - Price\nBTC/USD - Amount\nTSLA/USD - Price\nTSLA/USD - Amount\nPortfolio Value\n\n\n\n\n63,000\n0.7\n190\n200 + 99.47 = 299.47\n$100,999\n\n\n\nP.D: I dropped some decimal points without rounding which is why the value of the portfolio fluctuated down. We can theorise these are trading fees to make the study seem more realistic\nThe market moves again. Bitcoin maintains it’s price while Tesla recovers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBTC/USD - Price\nBTC/USD - Amount\nTSLA/USD - Price\nTSLA/USD - Amount\nPortfolio Value\n\n\n\n\n63,000\n0.7\n220\n299.47\n$109,983.4\n\n\n\nA profit of $5,983.4 is retained. Voila!\nThis of course, is a far cry from a perfect strategy. A few challenges come to mind:\n\nWhat if the price fluctuations do not benefit me?\nWhat if the market does not accept my order volumes recurrently?\nWhat if the investor does not have the resources to monitor the price in a fashion where benefits can be actioned upon?\n\nThis study doesn’t aim to give the reader a Moneyball on investing. If that was the case the author would be writing this study from some highly valued real state investment whereas I am now sitting in my humble home with a cat sitting on my lap.\nThis strategy is far from perfect, there isn’t a guarantee on price fluctuations sailing your way. What can be done, is to measure the number of “opportunities” that existed in the past across any tuple of financial instruments to best determine what instrument set to use.\nWith the strategy and tools set into place it becomes a matter of guiding an LLM across the study. The modus operandi for guiding the LLM across building the study is as follows:\n\nUsing prompt engineering practices, the LLM is preloaded with industry specific context, such as books & articles\nThe LLM is instructed to adopt a personality(a cluster of adjectives) to fit the deliverable. A scientific-journal grade article\nAn experiment is formulated without a hypothesis. The LLM is just requested to count, parse & draw data\nA decision model is structured by a human after inspecting the data and formulating a hypothesis\nThe LLM is instructed to plot the decision model, code is generated by the LLM\nThe code is inspected by hand with a fine tooth comb, this involves bug fixes and styling changes\nWith a usable study, further hypothesis are formulated. There are now new grounds to perform the same steps over the new questions\nRinse & repeat until a full study is built\n\nWARNING This scientific journal styled blog post is a live piece of knowledge that’s actively under development. It aims to study the progress of LLMs in the context of financial investigation & research on top of it’s actual objective\nhic sunt dracones, there can be bugs.
